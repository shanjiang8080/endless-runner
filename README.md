# Runner
This is my final project for 12th grade Computer Science. It's an endless runner game created using LibGDX.
Inspired by the mobile game [Chiki's Chase](https://chikischase.com), I wanted to create a game similar but smaller in scope.
It's playable through download, or online using [this link](https://shanjiang8080.github.io/endless-runner/). However, as the game was not designed for a web release, there may be some issues.
## How to Play
Begin by pressing the 'Go!' button. Tap, press spacebar, or press up to jump. You can also double jump. The goal is to jump across platforms and defeat enemies by jumping on them. Jumping and staying alive both net you points, but falling or getting hit by an enemy costs you health. You start with three health points, and can only recover a piece of health by collecting 100 coins, which appear throughout the game. As the game progresses, it speeds up! Try to survive as long as you can, there's a high-score system! Note that the web version does not save high-scores, since it was designed first and foremost for desktops.

## Process
This game was made in 3 weeks, where I spent my time learning the LibGDX framework and implementing the game. All art assets, excluding the font, were made by me in Aseprite. The font is NewHiScore, purchasable on [itch.io](https://bsl.itch.io/new-hi-score). It has taught me much about game development, and has inspired me to venture further with developing more games (as of yet unpublic).
